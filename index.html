    <h1>Bedecked in Trek</h1>

    <p>
        Haven't we all admired Seven of Nine for her shnazzy bodysuit and her struggles to reconcile herself with humanity after being a part of the Borg collective for so long? <br />
        Now you can showcase how you feel to the world through my collection of indelible memorbilla wrangled from the grubby hands of an armada's worth of Ferengi traders. Bought <br />
        and stocked for your perusal, I implore you to sift through my offerings and find the piece that speaks to you.
