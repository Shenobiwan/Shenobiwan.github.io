        Haven't we all admired Seven of Nine for her shnazzy bodysuit and her struggles to reconcile with humanity after being a part of the Borg collective for so long? <br />
        Now you can showcase how you feel to the world through my collection of indelible memorabilla wrangled from the grubby hands of an armada's worth of Ferengi traders.<br />
        Bought and stocked for your perusal, I implore you to sift through my offerings and find the piece that speaks to you.

        From swimwear to mousepads to your showercurtain - wherever you want to rock your Star Trek pride - I have you covered. With your new found goods you will find a surprising <br />
        array of opportunities to insert your favorite quotes into the hum-drum conversations of the everyday. <br />

        <ul style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            <li>Forgot to take trash out before getting into your medic styled jammies? Perfect occasion to say "Dammit I'm a doctor not a garbage collector!"</li> 
            <li>Having trouble finding occasions to say "Beam me up Scotty!"? Now you can get a rise out of your co-workers everyday with the heat-triggered transporter coffee mug! </li>
            <li>Nothing like a mouse pad of Picard face palming long before it was a meme, to give you the strength to laugh instead of joining a forum flame war.</li>
            <li>"Make it so" today - gather the dredges of your last paycheck together and buy a slice of utopia for yourself.</li>
        </ul>
