<p> Haven't we all admired Seven of Nine for her shnazzy 
                bodysuit and her brave struggle to reconcile with humanity after being a part of the Borg collective for so long? 
                <br /><br /> Now you can showcase how you feel to the world through my collection of indelible memorabilla wrangled 
                from the grubby hands of an armada's worth of Ferengi traders. Bought and stocked for your perusal, I implore you to
sift through my offerings and find the piece that speaks to you.</p>

        From swimwear to mousepads to your showercurtain - wherever you want to rock your Star Trek pride - I have you covered.<br>
        With your new found goods you will find a surprising array of opportunities to insert your favorite quotes into the hum-drum <br> 
        conversations of the everyday. <br /><br />


<ul class="indexlist">
            <li>Forgot to take trash out before getting into your medic styled jammies? Perfect occasion to say "Dammit I'm a doctor 
                not a garbage collector!"</li> 
            <li>Having trouble finding occasions to say "Beam me up Scotty!"? Now you can get a rise out of your co-workers everyday 
                with a heat-triggered transporter coffee mug! </li>
            <li>How about a mouse pad of Picard face-palming long before it was a meme to give you the strength to laugh instead of 
                joining a forum flame war?</li>
</ul>
   <br />
   <br />
   <br />
    <p>
        <em> "Make it so." </em>- gather the dredges of your last paycheck and buy a slice of utopia for yourself. Picard would be proud.
