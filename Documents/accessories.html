                Be the epitomy of cool with a communicator badge. Bluetooth enabled for today, and configured to emit the classic
                communicator chirp. Good luck not making this thing chirp all day, because it is too cool for school.

        BLAM - there's that original crew we hold near and dear at the first whiff of coffee. I <3 this cup and you should too.
