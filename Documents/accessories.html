                and most certainly fun to spin about, this item will serve you well both at work and at home.

                Be the epitomy of cool with a communicator badge. Bluetooth enabled for today, and configured to emit the classic
                communicator chirp. Good luck not making this thing chirp all day, because it is too cool for school.

                Start your work day with Picard, and let his face-palm remind you that 20+ more occasions to do this will occur 
                throughout the day but it will be okay. The high quality print is sure to make you smile every time it catches 
                your eye.
