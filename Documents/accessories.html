                Be the epitomy of cool with a communicator badge. Bluetooth enabled for today, and configured to emit the classic communicator chirp. Good luck not making this thing chirp all day, because it is too cool for school.

                Start your work day with Picard, and let his face-palm remind you that you will have 20+ more occasions to do this today alone but it will be okay. The high quality print is sure to make you smile every time it catches 
                your eye.

        Who doesn't need this?! This coffee mug shows an empty teleporter pad until your favorite hot beverage is added, and then BLAM - there's that original crew we hold near and dear at the first whiff of coffee. I <3 this cup and you should too.
