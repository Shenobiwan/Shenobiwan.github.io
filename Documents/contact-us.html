                Bedecked in Trek is a sole proprietorship based out of Valrico, FL. I frequented a lot of conventions and found that 
                my fellow trekkies had trouble locating licensed, quality merchandise and were incensed by the large companies out 
                there pumping out cheap items in the name of a dollar. Bedecked in Trek is striving to be a trusted name in fan 
                merchandise and every item is hand-picked for it's uniqueness and workmanship.
